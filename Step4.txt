Step 4:
A. What (general) direction is the sound coming from?
The sound is coming from the northwest direction.
B. Explain how you solved part A.
I know this because the first point that receives a ping is C, which means that the sound has to come from the north. The next point that receives a ping is B, which indicates that the sound is coming from the west. Put these two together [waves comes at an angle], and the sound is coming from the northwest.
C. If you only look at the difference of arrival between Hydrophone C and B, what general shape does all of the possible coordinates for the location of the sound make?
The general shape all the possible locations of the location of the sound makes a circle based on the positioning of C and B [see attached files].
D. What coordinates does the sound originate from (assuming it is on the same two dimensional plane)?
The coordinates are (-3.9276,4.4549).
E. If you were to solve this programmatically given any three time values, how would you do it?
I would find the TDoA of points C,B and C,A and calculate the distance from C. Then, I would plug these values into a system ofone  Since the location of C is known [we can preset its value to (0,0)], then we can set the other two points (B and C) away from it using their calculated distances. We can put them on the x-axis, and substitute these points into the equation of a circle, where (h,k) is the origin of the sound [Circle: (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2]. Round the decimals to a certain place, then run a loop comparing x and y values, increasing by a slight decimal point. Rinse and repeat.
