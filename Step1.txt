Step 1:
	Pipes are used to send information from one program to another, while shared memory is publically accessible to all. The downside to using shared memory is that the information being shared could be accessed by many programs at the same time, which could end up overwhelming the system. It can also cause more strain on other programs if the one source of data is constantly updating information that other programs cannot keep up with. Pipes, although more private and secluded, are easier to use and code, and are also more reliable than using shared memory, as it can easily communicate with another program one-on-one. Also, pipes are easier to program than shared memory, as the operating system for pipes is already embedded into them. Pipes are definitely a better method to use in order to make the sub more efficient with less processors.
